# ESP32-DataLogger-GoogleSheet

This project is in collaboration with my college friends: : Azizah, Chansa


This innovative project embraces Internet of Things (IoT) technology by combining the power of ESP32 to create a "sensor data logger." The ESP32 serves as the brain of the project, collecting data from various sensors or sources and automatically transmitting it to Google Sheets.
Through seamless integration, the data can be easily monitored, analyzed, and visualized in spreadsheet form. A smart solution for efficiently monitoring and recording data, this project opens doors to real-time monitoring and historical analysis using sophisticated yet user-friendly technology.

Thanks
